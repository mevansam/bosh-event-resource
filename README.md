# BOSH Event Resource

A [Concourse](http://concourse.ci/) resource to trigger pipelines based on events generated by a [BOSH](http://bosh.io) Director.

This resource is based off the "[BOSH deployment event](https://github.com/mkuratczyk/bosh-deployment-event-resource)" Concourse resource.

## Known Issues
This resource will emit metadata which lists deployment changes. However, due to Concourse's architecture it may not perfectly reflect the content of the backup.
This is because the metadata is collected during resource GET but backup is performed by your pipeline later (how much later depends on multiple factors, including what steps are there in your pipeline). Therefore some tasks can complete between the moment GET was executed and when the actual backup was taken and therefore the backup can contain changes not listed in the metadata.

## Source Configuration

For the source configuration you can specify either Bosh credentials or Pivotal Operations Manager credentials.

* Using Bosh credentials

    | Field  | Required | Type | Description
    |:-------|:--------:|:-----:|:----------
    | target | Y** | String | BOSH Director URL (eg. https://192.168.50.6:25555)
    | client | Y** | String | BOSH client (eg. admin)
    | client_secret | Y** | String | BOSH client's secret (password)
    | ca_cert | N** | String | BOSH Director CA Cert (as you would provide for BOSH CLI)
    | event_source | N | String | The user causing the event (i.e. health_monitor)
    | object_type | N | String | The type of object associated with the event (i.e. deployment)
    | excluded_deployments | N | Array | Deployment names that should be ignored (eg. ["bat", "dummy"])

* Using Pivotal Operations Manager credentials to access the managed Bosh director

    | Field  | Required | Type | Description
    |:-------|:--------:|:----:|:-----------
    | opsman_host | N** | String | Pivotal Operations Manager DNS name or Host IP
    | opsman_username | Y** | String | Login username
    | opsman_password | Y** | String | Login password
    | opsman_client_id | N** | String | Pivotal Operations Manager UAA client ID
    | opsman_client_secret | N** | Array | Pivotal Operations Manager UAA client ID's secret
    | skip_ssl_validation | N | Array | To skip SSL validation
    | event_source | N | String | The user causing the event (i.e. health_monitor)
    | object_type | N | String | The type of object associated with the event (i.e. deployment)
    | excluded_deployments | N | Array | Deployment names that should be ignored (eg. ["bat", "dummy"])

> \** If Bosh credentials are provided they will override the Operations Manager credentials. So provide only one to avoid confusion.

## Behavior

### `check`: Returns the date of the most recent create/update/delete deployment event since the previous check (version).

### `in`: Does nothing.

### `out`: Does nothing.

## Example Configuration

### Resource Type

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: bosh-deployment-event-resource
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: mkuratczyk/bosh-deployment-event-resource
```

### Resource

``` yaml
resources:
- name: deployment-changes
  type: bosh-deployment-event-resource
  source:
    target: https://192.168.50.6:25555
    client: admin
    client_secret: password
    ca_cert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    excluded_deployments: ["dummy", "bat"]
```

### Plan

This resource will only trigger your pipeline. You should have another task that perform the actual backup. Take a look [bbr-pcf-pipeline-tasks](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bbr-pcf-pipeline-tasks) for an example.

``` yaml
jobs:
- name: backup
  plan:
  - get: deployment-changes
    trigger: true
  - task: actual-backup-task
    ...
```
